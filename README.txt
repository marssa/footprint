This is the repository hosting the first implementation of the MARine Systems Software Architecture (MARSSA) on a Java platform. This repo was added here as a proof of concept for MARSSA. 

The project Marsec-XL/theDemonStrator uses this project as a dependency to showcase how different applications can benefit from using standard interfaces and datatypes.
